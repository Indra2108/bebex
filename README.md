OCTOBER

  SRCE : Merveilles
  NOTE : 'October' - Chine Meiville
  TYPE : book
  QOTE 
    > It's very easy to read, extremely lucid
    & The problem is, it's still a difficult read
    & At least at the moment, I'm early in the book, so there are a lot of things going on, some of them horrifying
    & A mix of xenophobes, fascists, and antisemites did some horrible things to toddlers :c
    & Traditional teaching of the history of the revolution in russia kind of ignores the horrific things that were happening that led up to it
    & I'm also going through the TTC russian history course ('From Peter the Great to Gorbachev'), and as far as I can tell, they completely pass over the mass protests and the sheer disregard for human life that the previous regime had (edited)
    & I recommend it, but it's a difficult read for the same sorts of reasons that "Why I don't talk [to whit

  TERM 
    > Exocortex: "An exocortex is a hypothetical artificial external information processing system that would augment a brain's biological high-level cognitive processes.
    & An individual's exocortex would be composed of external memory modules, processors, IO devices and software systems that would interact with, and augment, a person's biological brain. Typically this interaction is described as being conducted through a direct brainâ€“computer interface, making these extensions functionally part of the individual's mind.
    & Individuals with significant exocortices could be classified as cyborgs or posthumans."
